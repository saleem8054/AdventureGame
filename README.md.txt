Hello,
Welcome to Adventure Game. When you open the project,it might seems confusing at the first glance but I have made it easier for you.

First of all,I want you to look at the picture namely AdventureGameDirection to understand the directions of the game.
When you will run the code,you will be automatically be placed at "Road"(look at the picture).

Secondly,You will have different options in the console printed out to go the location of your choice using N,E,W,S and Q for quit.

Enjoy my little JAVA project.
